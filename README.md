# Overview

This software is a basic implementation of a contact-book manager that runs in the terminal. It uses functions, classes, variables (mutable and immutable), loops, conditionals, collections, etc. It manages two types of contacts: personal and business. A user can add, edit, search for, display, and delete contacts from their contact book. Functionality has also been added to prevent the user from adding duplicate contacts. All of the software has been written in Kotlin and developed in IntelliJ Idea. 

This software has been written to showcase my mastery of the fundamentals of Kotlin, which is a very popular language used in mobile application development, particularly Android development. As an aspiring full-stack developer, it would be very beneficial for me to learn the basics of mobile app development if I want to be able to assist in mobile app versions of the websites and web applications that I develop. The hope is that showing my knowledge of the fundamentals of mobile app development will make me more desireable and marketable to potential employers.
